#Accounting Program
Here you can count your income and cost by input your invoices.

###This is how it's works.
- [ ] First add data of company you want.
- [ ] Select company and add invoice to it.
- [ ] After adding few invoices you can check you summary in view named "show all invoices". Here you will see all netto, brutto and vat values for sell and buy direction.

### Otherwise you can:
* Edit your company or invoice data,
* Add next company or invoice,
* Delete company or invoice. 

Remember that, if you delete company you will lose all your invoices in database too.
